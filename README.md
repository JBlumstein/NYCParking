<h1>NYC Parking Tickets Choropleths Example</h1>

<p>Fun with Pandas and Folium to create choropleths, using 30M+ NYC parking ticket summons from NYC from 2013-2016. Data sourced from Socrata's NYC Open Data portal. The main analysis is in the Jupyter notebook.</p>

<p>An example choropleth (same choropleth as in notebook), for the total number of summonses given in each NYC precinct for "Stopping, standing or parking within a marked bicycle lane" in 2014 and 2015:</p>
